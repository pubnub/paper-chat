*Note: I decided to separate a repo for the new Polymer 1.x Paper Chat, and it is available on [github.com/pubnub/polymer-cat-chat-v1](https://github.com/pubnub/polymer-cat-chat-v1). A huge thanks to [Whyser](https://github.com/Whyser) for the Polymer 1.0 migration help!!!*

# Paper Chat Demo

A simple chat room in Material Design build with Polymer 0.5.x.

This demo is written for a tutorial to show how to create a simple chat app using [PubNub][pubnub] data stream JavaScript API for [Polymer][polymer], and Polymer's Paper elements to achieve [Material Design][md] user-experiences.

This is not currently compatible with the new Polymer 1.0.
If you build this app by yourself, make sure to use the appropriate version of Polymer and all other components, including `pubnub-element` v3.6.7.
See the [bower.json](https://github.com/pubnub/paper-chat/blob/gh-pages/bower.json) for the working versions for all dependencies.

## Polymer 1.x Support

Since Polymer 0.5x (used in this app) and the new Polymer 1.x are incompatible, I decided to create a new repo for the updated Kitteh Anonymous. 

However, if you wish to try, the gh-pages is available on [http://pubnub.github.io/paper-chat-v1](http://pubnub.github.io/paper-chat-v1).
The repo is still in private, but I will make it avalable sometimes.

And a huge thank you to [Whyser](https://github.com/Whyser), who migrated the app to Polymer 1.0 and sent me the pull request. I am so sorry that I have not got a chance to work on it.

I promise I will finish it up and write the tutorial!
